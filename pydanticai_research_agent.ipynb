    "# Building a Research Assistant using PydanticAI\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to build a *research assistant (Research + Summarization)* that helps users explore a research topic by iteratively:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generating search queries based on the userâ€™s input and performing web searches.  \n",
    "2. Extracting and summarizing relevant information from the search results.  \n",
    "3. Organizing and updating the collected information to maintain the state of the assistant.  \n",
    "4. Delivering a comprehensive research report to the user, complete with cited sources.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project takes inspiration from the LangGraph tutorial [available here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/research-rabbit/tree/main). However, it simplifies the implementation by eliminating unnecessary dependencies and complexities. It also focuses on providing a more efficient and streamlined solution using the PydanticAI framework.\n",
